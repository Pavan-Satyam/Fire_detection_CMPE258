# Fire_detection_CMPE258
The project aims to detect the presence of fire in a given image using neural networks, with the motivation being to minimize property damage and save human lives by enabling early fire detection. The project will experiment with various neural network architectures to identify a model that can predict with high accuracy and in the least amount of time. The application of this project is in fire detection systems, which can be used by authorities to identify the location of the fire and extinguish it.
